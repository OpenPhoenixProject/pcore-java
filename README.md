Pcore for Java
==============

This is an implementation of the Pcore specification written in Java. It is work in progress
at this point.

TODO:
* More tests needed to reach 100% code coverage
* Type.normalize() not fully implemented yet
* Optimize instanceOf (relies to heavily on infer now)
* A better README.md (obviously)
* More extensive Javadoc
* Examples of usage
* Cross-language integration tests (Ruby/Clojure)
